## Core Components

Genesis Agent consists of several core components that work together to provide a comprehensive financial intelligence system:

### 1. Core Engine

The core engine (`core.py`) is the central component that coordinates all other modules. It handles initialization, scheduling, and communication between components.

```python
from genesis_agent.core import GenesisCore

# Initialize the core engine
core = GenesisCore()

# Start the system
core.start()
```

### 2. Database Manager

The database manager (`database.py`) handles data persistence, including market data, strategy configurations, and execution results.

```python
from genesis_agent.database import DatabaseManager

# Initialize the database manager
db = DatabaseManager()

# Save data
db.save_execution("strategy_manager", "execution_id", execution_data)

# Query data
results = db.query_executions("strategy_manager", filters={"status": "success"})
```

### 3. Analysis Engine

The analysis engine (`analysis.py`) provides tools for market analysis, including technical indicators, pattern recognition, and sentiment analysis.

```python
from genesis_agent.analysis import AnalysisEngine

# Initialize the analysis engine
analysis = AnalysisEngine()

# Get market data
data = analysis.get_market_data("AAPL", "1d", 30)

# Calculate technical indicators
rsi = analysis.calculate_rsi(data, 14)
macd = analysis.calculate_macd(data)
```

### 4. Trading Engine

The trading engine (`trading.py`) executes trades across various platforms, including stock markets and cryptocurrency exchanges.

```python
from genesis_agent.trading import TradingEngine

# Initialize the trading engine
trading = TradingEngine()

# Execute a trade
result = trading.execute_trade({
    "type": "buy",
    "market_id": "AAPL",
    "quantity": 10,
    "price": 150.0
})
```

### 5. Model Manager

The model manager (`models.py`) handles machine learning models for prediction and analysis.

```python
from genesis_agent.models import ModelManager

# Initialize the model manager
models = ModelManager()

# Train a model
model = models.train_model("price_prediction", data, target="close")

# Make predictions
predictions = models.predict(model, new_data)
```

### 6. Security Manager

The security manager (`security.py`) provides authentication, encryption, and access control.

```python
from genesis_agent.security import SecurityManager

# Initialize the security manager
security = SecurityManager()

# Authenticate a user
auth_result = security.authenticate({
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password"
})

# Check access
access_result = security.check_access(
    auth_result["token"],
    "trading",
    "execute_trade"
)
```

### 7. AI Strategy Manager

The AI strategy manager (`ai_strategy.py`) creates, deploys, and manages AI-powered strategies.

```python
from genesis_agent.ai_strategy import AIStrategyManager

# Initialize the AI strategy manager
strategy_manager = AIStrategyManager()

# Create a strategy
strategy_result = strategy_manager.create_strategy(
    "undervalued_asset_finder",
    {
        "name": "My Undervalued Asset Finder",
        "parameters": {
            "min_market_cap": 1000000000,
            "max_pe_ratio": 20
        }
